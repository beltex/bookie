TODO
======

- Automated means for making changes to schema and have everyone else be able to get latest changes
- CI (Jenkins)
- Unit testing framework (very important for auto schema work & CI)
- Define VERSIONS for our tech stack elements (seriously guys!). What version of PHP? MySQL? etc
- Git branching model (YES WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS)
- Everyone up to speed on how to use Git
- Removed the Apache 2 license, now that its closed source, do we need one?
- Move repo to GitHub Organization such that its independent of everyone (because Zain doesn't trust me :))
- Server for deploying app (Windows Azure - Zain)
